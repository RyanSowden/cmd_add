#CMDADD

This is a basic programming which will hold contact details for each individual user as the log in.

This is extremely basic as I am using it to learn Java, below are a list of things left to do:

.Checking if user has been created, if they have been, throw error to select a different name
.User sessions
.Add/Delete contact
.Edit exsiting contact
.Logout
